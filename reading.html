    <h1>Readings</h1>
    <div class="grey-text">
        <p>You can find some of the books I read in the past on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135530195-jannik">Goodreads</a>.</p>
        <p>The way I tend to learn most effectively is autodidactic and quite obsessively for some time. Thus, I get exposed to a lot of different fields with high intensity.</p>
        <p>I am currently reading and thinking about Political Philosophy and History.</p>
        <h3>April and May 2023</h3>
        <p>In the past two months, I read and thought a lot about human intelligence research and its implications. It is quite striking how fundamental many of the questions asked are for making sense of the world. Nature vs. Nurture comes up in so many different contexts, thinking about the treatment effect of colleges reveals so much about human nature, and seeing the current discourse on College Admissions and Standardised Testing diagnoes more about the public sentiment in the United States than any object-level questions. I am quite interested to learn more about the intersection of Neuroscience and ML.</p>
        <p>It is also quite striking, again, how low the bar to being good in a field often is. Getting to the frontier of the field and being able to understand what people are discussing and refering to only took me a couple of weeks, even though there are so many more detailed questions I have not explored at all. Another practical example of the Pareto Principle.</p>
