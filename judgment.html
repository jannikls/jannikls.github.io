    <h1>Notes on Developing Judgment</h1>
    <div class="grey-text">
    <p>I have been thinking about judgment for the past couple of months. Here are a few initial notes.</p>
    <p>Developing judgment does not feel learning hard skills because it is of a different nature.</p>
    <p>It now seems plausible that one can develop judgment. There is more signal in low base-rates event than we think.</p>
    <p>Judgment requires context. Advice does not generalise. That means, answering the question "What would you advice a college student to do?" with some generic advice is not helpful.</p>
    <p>Similarly, one needs to be diligent about giving advice. Holding people to higher rigour seems reasonable.</p>
    <p>It always struck me how most VCs wait for the right founder to just show up. If you believe that entrepreneurs need some form of training and that universities do not produce entrepreneurs, than there is a lack of institutions that do this. Arguably, a great founder needs to be excellent in various domains, including good judgment, and I am not arguing VCs should lower their talent standards (if at all, they should probably raise it). At the same time, one can not expect young, smart, and ambitious people to have good judgment (yet). If they have, that's great and updates me towards them. But if they don't, it's teachable (like many other  things).</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, there are much more potentially great entrepreneurs in the world, but there is a lack of people that helps people aspire towards the right set of aspirations and develop their judgment. One reason why there are only so few great founders is the lack of focus on how to help exceptionally talented people with an entrepreneurial aptitude <u>become</u> great founders.</p>
