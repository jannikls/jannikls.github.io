    <h1>Hayek and Centrally Planned Economies</h1>
    <div class="grey-text">
        <p>There is a thought experiment that I was thinking about a couple years ago. I was recently rereading some of F.A. Hayek's work and found interesting answers.</p>
        <p>Here is the experiment. Consider a future where have quantum computers with access to all public data and incredibly fast and cheap compute. Why would one such computer not be able to outperform any centrally planned economy?</p>
        <p>Hayek's answer is that information are wildly distributed across the population and inform their actions, often in ways they cannot really articulate. Additionally, much of this knowledge is created through social interactions that wouldn't happen in a centrally planned economy.</p>
        <p>In his nobel lecture in 1977, Milton Friedman cites Hayek's 1945 paper and claims that higher inflation disrupts the signals arising from relative-price movements.</p>
