I am a physicist by training and currently learning about technical frontiers, especially AI. I live in San Francisco and grew up in Germany. I was previously an investor at Founders Fund.  I actively angel invest in technical founders working on frontiers.

At a young age, I studied theoretical physics where I researched galaxy simulations and star formation. After two years, I came to the conclusion that theoretical physics stagnated and left the field. I still think about ways to fix foundational science and try reading as many physics papers as I can (email me your favourites).

When I was 17, I first came to Silicon Valley through an AI Fellowship. It became clear to me that technology companies are the main path to work on frontier problems; most institutions that previously enabled great technical talent to work on frontier problems need to be rebuilt. Today, I like to build and invest in companies that either have a serious chance of pushing technical frontiers or help fix the social coordination problems of our time. 

I like to [write](https://www.theschillingpoint.com/) [essays](/writing) and read [obscure books](/bookshelf/). Philosophers I return to include the early rationalists, especially Francis Bacon and Immanuel Kant, as well as Leo Strauss. Novelists I like include Dostoevsky, Jane Austen, Thomas Mann, Marcel Proust, and Goethe.
