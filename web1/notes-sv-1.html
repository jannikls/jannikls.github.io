      <p>I spent the past two weeks in Silicon Valley. Here are a few of my updated notes and observations.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley certainly has elements of a monoculture: Most people read similar blogs, have similar aspirations, eat the same pre-made meals, and have similar friends. Why is that?</p>
      <p>Here is the Girardian Reading: Because <b>other</b> people desire things like founding a company and being a contrarian, more and more people start desiring the same thing. Henceforth, we should expect intense mimetic rivalry.</p>
      <p>Why is Silicon Valley not an incubator of Girardian Terorr? </p>
      <p>Let's start with a simple observation. Allow me to exemplify: I spent two months in NYC. Over there, there are legible status markers like one's sense of fashion, beautifulness, salary, hours worked, prestige of company. For any set of people, everybody will likely agree on an ordered set based on status. New York seems higher anxiety - transplants and focus.</p>
      <p>One argument that seems plausible is that status in SV is not obvious for a decently long amount of time.</p>
      <p>There is an internal mediator effect: People start imidating each other, but need to make sure nobody <b>thinks</b> they are imitating someone else. Because of this dynamic, beliefs often spread rapidly.</p>
      <p>In SV, this is somewhat different. It is obvious that there are certain extremely high-status individuals. People like Peter Thiel or Elon Musk. And there are also obviously low-status people, like management consultants. But then there is a large middleground set of people where the status order is everything but clear. People have different orders, if they are able to come up with any at all. One reason is that the main status marker "Built a big company" is a lagging indicator with a couple of years in delay. There are priors, like pedigree, but they are non-deterministic for status and there is a constant fear of dismissing outsiders or non-obvious individuals.</p>
      <p>One reason for that is that many people actually experienced someone being wildly successful that they dismissed in the past.</p>
      <p>The overhanging fear of dismissing wildly successful people might actually lead to worse decision and slower judgment-building.</p>
      <h3>Silicon Valley is a good Ecosystem to incubate Ideas</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>the more homonogeous, the smarter and better you need to be</h3>
      There is an expectation of being smart.
      <h3>Everybody is afraid to dismiss the outsider</h3>
