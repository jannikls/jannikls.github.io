Here are some research questions that I am currently thinking about:
1. Why has progress in neuroscience in the last decade been so depressing?
  * Neuroscience has been too dogmatic for at least ten years.
2. What are underappreciated science projects?
  * Simulating the brain of worms, and beyond. A good starting point is [We Haven't Uploaded Worms](https://www.jefftk.com/p/we-havent-uploaded-worms).
  * Whole-body human simulations on cellular level. I haven't found too much good research work on this yet. Most papers model parts of some living organism, like [Whole-body simulation of realistic fruit fly locomotion](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.11.584515v1). I am interested in more holistic approaches, and more human centred ones.
