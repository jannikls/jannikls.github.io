Please [email me](mailto:janniklschilling@gmail.com) book recommendations. The books listed below do not reflect my personal views, as I read books with a broad range of views. As Montaigne put it, *"All I say is by way of discourse, and nothing by way of advice."*

#### Rare(-ish) Books
The Great Books are rightly held in high regard. However, even if you believe that most Great Books are recognized at some point as works of great merit, you should not be blinded and believe that there are no great but forgotten books. There are books that are too wrong, maybe too dangerous, or simply out-of-fashion and are thus not well-known at all today. While I haven't found as many of these books as I would like yet, I want to share a few here to illustrate my argument. If you come across any forgotten books that you think are great, please [email me](mailto:janniklschilling@gmail.com)!

1. Ivan Turgenev: Smoke, A Novel.
2. Ivan Turgenev: Virgin Soil.
2. Normann Angell: The Great Illusion; Recommendation from Peter.
3. Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov: War, Progress, and the end of History, Including a Short Story of the Anti-Christ. Three Discussions; Recommendation from Peter.
4. Wendell Willkie: One World; Recommendation from Peter.

### Physics Textbooks
I learned most physics through German textbooks which I will not link here. The few English ones I still own are:
1. Gravitation: Charles W. Misner, John Archibald Wheeler, and Kip Thorne
1. An Introduction to Differential Geometry: T. J. Willmore
2. Tensors: Mathematics of Differential Geometry and Relativity: Zafar Ahsan
3. Curvature in Mathematics and Physics: Shlomo Sternberg
4. TBC

I sometimes come across interesting memos and curate the best ones below.
1. <a href="https://airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=213075">"The Downfall of a Great American Airplane Company: An Insider's Perspective"</a> Memo by Boeing engineers on the downfall of their commercial airline division.
2. <a href="https://medium.com/@sosofancy/the-secret-diary-of-a-sustainable-investor-part-1-70b6987fa139">The Secret Diary of a ‘Sustainable Investor’</a> Memo by Tariq Fancy, former CIO for Sustainable Investing at Blackrock, outlining why ESG is not working.
