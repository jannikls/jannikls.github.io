    <p>I currently spent most of my time in Germany and SF. Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>I grew up in Germany. At age 13, I enrolled in university, where I studied theoretical physics and did research on galaxy & star formation. My favourite area of physics is gravitational theory, and my favourite physics book is "Gravitation" by Misner, et al.</li>
      <li>Before turning 18, I worked as a management consulting firm for a year & co-founded a Climate Tech startup with a former senior partner. I was also an Entrepreneur in Residence at EF.</li>
      <li>I love building things. I am an autodidact and like reading and thinking about about decision theory, economics, psychology, maths, history, evolutionary biology, classic fiction, and much more. Earlier this year, I thought about:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am currently thinking about Germany's talent crisis, sacrifices, and classical fiction works.</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li><em>On talent:</em> I was researching the importance of human intelligence and spoke about my conclusions at <a href="https://isironline.org/2023/01/isir-2023-berkeley-california-july-26-29/">ISIR 2023</a>. I believe that the most talented people drive wealth creation and intellectual progress. Talent allocation of the most talented individuals is unusually ineffective, if progress is the main objective.</li>
      <li><em>On advice:</em> Good advice is incredibly rare. Giving and receiving advice requires good judgement. If you want to give better advice, ask yourself <a href="https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/#" target="_blank">&quot;What is going on with this human?&quot;</a>.</li>
      <li><em>On science:</em> The replication crisis is real, and a significant share of our knowledge is wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I sometimes write essays on topics loosely related to progress, talent, history, tech, and more. You can follow my future <a href="https://jschg.substack.com/">Substack</a> here.</p>
