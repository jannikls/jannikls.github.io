    <p>I am a Talent Investor at Entrepreneur First (EF).<br/><br/>Some things about me:<br/></p>
    <ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item-3">Grew up in Germany, building tech stuff.</li>
      <li class="list-item-4">At age 13, I enrolled in college, where I studied theoretical physics and did research in Astrophysics on star formation. My favourite area of physics is general relativity, my favourite physics book is &quot;Gravitation&quot; by Misner, et al. </li><li class="list-item-5">Before graduating high school, I worked for a mgmt consulting firm for around a year, founded an ESG startup with a senior executive, and was an <em>Entrepreneur in Residence</em> at EF.</li><li class="list-item-5">Currently doing research in progress studies and high ability studies.</li></ul>
    <p class="paragraph2">Writing:<br/></p><ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item-3">I sometimes write essays on topics losely related to progress, talent, history, tech, and more.<br/></li><li class="list-item-3">Most pieces are not publicly available at the moment. If you know someone that loves editing unfinished drafts, please let me know.<br/></li></ul>
    <p class="paragraph2">What I am currently thinking about:<br/></p><ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item-3"><em>On talent<br/></em>I believe that the most talented people drive wealth creation and intellectual progress.<br/>Besides exceptional intelligence, drive and bias to action seem to be strong predictors of achieving eminence.<br/>Talent allocation of the most talented individuals is unusually ineffective, if progress is the main objective.</li><li class="list-item-3"><em>On advice<br/></em>Good advice is incredibly rare. If you want to give good advice, ask yourself <a href="https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/#" target="_blank">&quot;What is going on with this human?&quot;</a><em><br/></em></li><li class="list-item-3"><em>On science<br/></em>The replication crisis is real, a significant share of our knowledge is wrong.</li></ul><p class="paragraph2">Investing:<br/></p>
    <ul role="list" class="list"><li class="list-item-3"> I am open to consider <em>small</em> angel investments. I&#x27;d love to run a grant-making programme eventually to enable moonshots by young people.<br/></li><li class="list-item-3"> I am particularly interested to invest in exceptionally smart and ambitious teams. My areas of interest are: AI, enterprise software, and longevity / biotechnology.<br/></li><li class="list-item-3">You can email me: <em>janniklschilling@gmail.com.</em></li></ul>
