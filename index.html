      <h1 class="heading">Jannik Schilling</h1>
      <p>I am a Talent Investor at Entrepreneur First (EF).</p>
      <p>Some things about me:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="list-item-3">Grew up in Germany, building tech stuff.</li>
        <li class="list-item-4">At age 13, I enrolled in college, where I studied theoretical physics and did research in Astrophysics on star formation. My favourite area of physics is general relativity, and my favourite physics book is "Gravitation" by Misner, et al.</li>
        <li class="list-item-5">Before graduating high school, I worked for a management consulting firm for around a year, founded an ESG startup with a senior executive, and was an <em>Entrepreneur in Residence</em> at EF.</li>
        <li class="list-item-5">Currently doing research in progress studies and high ability studies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Writing:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="list-item-3">I sometimes write essays on topics loosely related to progress, talent, history, tech, and more.</li>
        <li class="list-item-3">Most pieces are not publicly available at the moment. If you know someone that loves editing unfinished drafts, please let me know.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What I am currently thinking about:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="list-item-3"><em>On talent:</em> I believe that the most talented people drive wealth creation and intellectual progress. Besides exceptional intelligence, drive and bias to action seem to be strong predictors of achieving eminence. Talent allocation of the most talented individuals is unusually ineffective if progress is the main objective.</li>
        <li class="list-item-3"><em>On advice:</em> Good advice is incredibly rare. If you want to give good advice, ask yourself <a href="https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/#" target="_blank">&quot;What is going on with this human?&quot;</a></li>
        <li class="list-item-3"><em>On science:</em> The replication crisis is real, and a significant share of our knowledge is wrong.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Investing:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li class="list-item-3">I am open to considering <em>small</em> angel investments. I'd love to run a grant-making program eventually to enable moonshots by young people.</li>
        <li class="list-item-3">I am particularly interested in investing in exceptionally smart and ambitious young people. I have a slight preference for the following areas: AI, enterprise software, and longevity/biotechnology.</li>
        <li class="list-item-3">You can email me at <em>janniklschilling@gmail.com</em>.</li>
