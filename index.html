    <h1>Jannik Schilling</h1>
    <div class="grey-text">
    <p>I am a Talent Investor at Entrepreneur First (EF) and an Atlas Fellow.</p>
    <p>Some things about me:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>I grew up in Germany and spent the majority of my formative years trying to understand the physics of the universe. At age 13, I enrolled in university, where I studied theoretical physics and did research in Astrophysics on star formation. My favourite area of physics is general relativity and gravitational theory, and my favourite physics book is "Gravitation" by Misner, et al. I also build fun software and hardware projects and thought about decision theory, economics, psychology, maths, history, and evolutionary biology.</li>
      <li>Before graduating high school, I worked for a management consulting firm for around a year and co-founded a Climate Tech startup with a former senior partner. I was also an <em>Entrepreneur in Residence</em> at EF.</li>
      <li>Currently doing research in Progress Studies, High Ability Studies, and AI Safety.</li>
      <li>I spend most of my time in Germany and SF. I used to live in New York and London for a few months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What I am currently thinking about:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li><em>On talent:</em> I believe that the most talented people drive wealth creation and intellectual progress. Besides exceptional intelligence, drive and bias to action seem to be strong predictors of achieving eminence. Talent allocation of the most talented individuals is unusually ineffective, if progress is the main objective.</li>
      <li><em>On advice:</em> Good advice is incredibly rare. Giving and receiving advice requires good judgement. If you want to give better advice, ask yourself <a href="https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/#" target="_blank">&quot;What is going on with this human?&quot;</a>.</li>
      <li><em>On science:</em> The replication crisis is real, and a significant share of our knowledge is wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Writing:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>I sometimes write essays on topics loosely related to progress, talent, history, tech, and more. You can <a href="https://jschg.substack.com/">follow my future Substack here</a>.</li>
      <li>Most pieces are not publicly available, though I might publish some in the future. Feel free to email me if you are interested in reading some of my writing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reach out to me:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>You can reach me at <em>janniklschilling (at) gmail (dot) com</em> or chat with me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jannikschg">Twitter</a>. I am particularly interested in meeting talented and ambitous people early in their life.</li>
      <li>I am open to consider angel investments.</li>
    </ul></div>
