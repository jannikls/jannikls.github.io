    <h1>Jannik Schilling</h1>
    <p>I am a Talent Investor at Entrepreneur First (EF) and an Atlas Fellow. I spend most of my time in Hamburg, New York, London, and SF.</p>
    <p>Some things about me:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>Grew up in Germany, thinking about the universe, building tech projects, and learning about lots of different areas.</li>
      <li>At age 13, I enrolled in college, where I studied theoretical physics and did research in Astrophysics on star formation. My favourite area of physics is general relativity, and my favourite physics book is "Gravitation" by Misner, et al.</li>
      <li>Before graduating high school, I worked for a management consulting firm for around a year, founded an ESG startup with a senior executive, and was an <em>Entrepreneur in Residence</em> at EF.</li>
      <li>Currently doing research in progress studies, high ability studies, and AI Safety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Writing:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>I sometimes write essays on topics loosely related to progress, talent, history, tech, and more.</li>
      <li>Most pieces are not publicly available, though I might publish some in the future. Feel free to email me if you are interested in reading some of my writing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What I am currently thinking about:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li><em>On talent:</em> I believe that the most talented people drive wealth creation and intellectual progress. Besides exceptional intelligence, drive and bias to action seem to be strong predictors of achieving eminence. Talent allocation of the most talented individuals is unusually ineffective if progress is the main objective.</li>
      <li><em>On advice:</em> Good advice is incredibly rare. If you want to give better advice, ask yourself <a href="https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/#" target="_blank">&quot;What is going on with this human?&quot;</a>.</li>
      <li><em>On science:</em> The replication crisis is real, and a significant share of our knowledge is wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Investing:</p>
    <ul class="enumeration">
      <li>I am open to considering <em>small</em> angel investments. I'd love to run a grant-making program eventually to enable moonshots by young people.</li>
      <li>I am particularly interested in investing in exceptionally smart and ambitious young people. I have a slight preference for the following areas: AI (Safety), enterprise software, and longevity/biotechnology.</li>
